I found the most challenging part of this app to be actually trying to get the 4 multipul choice answers to stack in 2 colums like I had planned.  I ended up having to put in a lot of <div>'s to make them sort the way I wanted.  I though about making it easier on myself and just letting them be in one column but I went with the challenge.  This turned out to cause a bit of a problem with accessability though because tab wouldn't cycle through all the answer options so I had to work around that by adding tabindex="0" to each answer option.  

tweaking plans:
add fading in and out for the questions and resluts
hover over effects for the answer options and buttons
